Imagine RIT Playtesting

Grade k=8
Grade 1=7
Grade 2=5
Grade 3=6
Grade 4=11
Grade 5+=16
*There were more kids who we did not record, in all we tested at least 50 if not a few more

Common issues:
-Students will go directly for mouse (even if it is hidden from sight)
-Using shift key takes a while for kid to figure out. Very hesitant to push at first even when prompted. Once sees it works then pick up on the controls very quickly
	-Often go for arrow keys first

Suggestions:
-loose condition
-do not show current time
-Military time
-Customize clocks
-mouse
-5th Grade use fractions/ word problems
	-roman numerals
-Score
	-Keep score out of 10
-Play against computer
-Timed (45 seconds)
-Visual feedback
	-confetti
	-receive medal
-hours green minutes red
-As get closer to correct time hand changes 

**unintended competition arose when two kids who knew each other played at the same time
